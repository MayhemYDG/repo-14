# Topology Aware Register and PM Capsule Interface

TPMI (Topology Aware Register and PM Capsule Interface) is a flexible, extendable and software-driver-enumerable MMIO interface for Power Management (PM) features. TPMI, planned for future Intel® Xeon® processor generations, is designed using an architectural PCI-e standards-based model so that PM feature support can be provided cleanly as a driver and not as part of the base OS.
